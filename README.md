Hydro is a module for Godot 3.2 which allows rigid bodies to behave realistically in water.  For installation and usage instructions, read the documentation folder.

This is based on https://gitlab.com/ringtechsolutions/godot-tools/hydro/hydro

Looking for volunteers to help. Documentation, coding and general feedback.
